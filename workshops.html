  <div class="workshop">
      <h2>Algorithmic Botany</h2>
      <div><b>Audience</b>: Students, Adults</div>
      <div><b>Level</b>: Intermediate, previous basic programming experience required</div>
      <div><b>Duration</b>: 1 day</div>
      <div><b>Keywords</b>: L-Systems, phyllotaxis, string rewriting, zoetrope, parabola's equation, procedural generated content</div>
      <div><b>Available in the following languages</b>: English, Italian, German</div>
          <div><b>Description:</b>
          The goal of the workshop is to give the practical and theoretical instruments to generate 2D or 3D form of trees, with any degree of abstraction. We are not looking for realism, but for generative processes and their visuals applications. The generated forms can be used for videogames, design, illustrations or 3D printing.
              The workshops is structured as follow:
              <ul>
              <li>A short introduction to computer generated trees in art and videogames, from Harun Faroki to Horizon Zero Dawn.</li>
              <li>L-System, Turtle graphics and string rewriting. Overview of the grammars described by Aristid Lindenmayer in "The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants". The participant will write an interpreter that implements one of these grammars.
                  <li>An overview of the openFrameworks addons dedicated to L-Systems and tree generation. Overview of the same tools in the javascript world. The partecipant will learn how to use them in its own project.</li>
              <li>Phyllotaxis. An overview of phyllotaxis in common flowers and trees. The participant will: 1) Write its own implementation of the algorithm in javascript. 2) Use its algorithm in a three.js scene 3) Add a third dimension in order to generate 3D abstract forms 4) Add a GUI in order to experiment with parametric design.</li>
              <li>How to draw a leaf using parabola's equation. We will start in 2d, and we will see how to introduce the third dimension in our sketch. We will then see how this equation could be applied to draw blades of grass.</li>
              </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="ws-notes">The workshops will not focus on any particular language, but on the concepts and on the implementation's steps. As we need a common playground to work together, I've opted for three.js and openFrameworks. If the partecipants are more familiar with processing, we can switch to Processing. Anyway, the goal of the workshop is to give you the instruments to implement your own generative forms in the programming language or framework of your choice.
