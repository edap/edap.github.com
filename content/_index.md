{{< video-4-3 url="https://player.vimeo.com/video/128782688">}}

I am a software developer with 20 years of experience based in Berlin.
I have been [lecturing](/teaching) at Universität der Künste in the [New Media](https://newmedia.udk-berlin.de/about) department and I have co-founded in 2006 the [IOCOSE](http://iocose.org) art collective.


<!-- I design and build immersive 3D web experiences, focusing on clarity, performance, and long-term maintainability for both the visual layers and the underlying infrastructure. -->

I currently offer two core freelance services:

### 3D Web Graphics & Interactive Visualization

- I design and build complex 3D web applications using Three.js, WebGL/WebGPU, and React or vanilla Javascript — with a strong focus on performance, real-time interaction, and platform stability. From physics-driven simulations to GIS-integrated visualizations, I help teams bring spatial data, scientific concepts, and interactive environments to life in the browser. With years of hands-on experience profiling graphics performance and integrating real-time systems, I help you turn complex ideas into smooth, intuitive, and scalable web experiences.

### Backend Infrastructure, APIs & CLI Tools

- I build fast, secure backend systems and custom CLI tools using Ruby, Rust, and Go — with production experience across PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Docker, and modern API design. I focus on crafting robust, maintainable REST APIs, automating development workflows, and building tools that are easy to deploy and operate on Linux servers. With a pragmatic approach and 20 years of experience, I deliver backend code that’s clean, testable, and built to support real-world applications — from internal dev tools to user-facing services.
