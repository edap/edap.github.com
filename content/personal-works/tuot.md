description: "T.U.O.T is a ray tracer software that does not follow the physical laws of light transmission, but instead speculates on new imaginary rules that dictate light behaviour. As software-generated digital images become increasingly popular and contribute to shape our perception of the world, the question arises, what that world would look like if the software generating the images did not follow the physical laws we are familiar with?
