              My research focuses on the implementation of primitive geometric forms in programming. In particular, I am interested in the forms suggesting the organic, such as animals, flowers or trees. This implementation functions in two directions; on one side it joins together separate elements in order to obtain a complex structure. On the other side, a complex structure disassembles into abstract shapes.<br />
            The aim of this research is to explore human uncertainty in the recognition of the organic in the digital.
