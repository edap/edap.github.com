of german irregular verbs"

<p>
2 weeks ago I have bought this <a href
="http://pragprog.com/book/dsproc/rapid-android-development">book</a> written
by <a href="http://danielsauter.com/">Daniel Sauter</a>, and I really enjoy it.
Within 3 weeks my first very simple android application, an 8-bit looklike
<a href ="http://edapx.com/ja-irre-verben/">videogame to learn participle forms
of german irregular verbs</a>, was on the google play store.<p/>
<p>
Processing was thought to "make things talk". Touch, move, shake, flip,
pinch, use it as natural as possible. The smartphone's surface could be a
superlative battlefield for Processing, more than a computer screen. You are dedicated
to the gestures as soon as you start to develop, and not to technical aspects.<p/>

<p>
It was pretty surprising how fast the development has been, from the idea to the store, and I think that processing is an absolutely valuable
candidate to develop android app prototypes. Processing is based on Java, it could
integrate all the functionalities provided by the Android API.I think that in the
future we will see more processing libraries based on the android API, like <a
	href="https://code.google.com/p/ketai/">The Ketai library</a>,
a library to use gestures events in a processing sketch.
There is still some aspects where it is better to work
directly with Java (for example, in my application i need to parse a JSON file,
and i can't find a way to do it in processing), but i think that problem like this will be solved soon.<p/>
