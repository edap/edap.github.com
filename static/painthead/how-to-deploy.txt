from the repository of the project (2025-painthead), run `npm run build`, then `npm run preview` to check it locally.

If you are just updating js or css, do this:
- copy the .js and .css file that are in dist/assets/ to edap.github.com/static/painthead/assets


If you are redoing everyhing, assets included, do this:
- copy the dist/assets folder to edap.github.com/static/painthead/assets



In both cases, 
- open the .js file. Change all the occurency of `/assets/` with `/painthead/assets/`
- correct the path of the new .js and .css in the layout file located at edap.github.com/layouts/painthead.html
- deploy and test.
