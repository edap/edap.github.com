To find oneself in "alto mare" (at high seas), is an Italian expression  often used to indicate the condition of being still far away from a  goal, for example, to be late for an upcoming deadline. To be in "alto  mare" implies that a lot of work still needs to be done. More steps need  to be taken before something is complete. Also, it is important to note  that you do not need to be at sea to find yourself in "alto mare." On  the contrary, such a condition can happen even while hiking a mountain, that, according to your plans, was supposed to be an easy task but  instead is not. Its peak just seems to never get closer. This animation questions if the feeling of being in altomare can be experienced in the very act of seeing, when it is difficult to recognize familiar shapes, colors and movements, and the calm that may arise when the peak of the mountain remains a mirage.
